# Overview

This is the beginning to a 1v1 resource management/tower defense game. It is not exactly working well yet, but soon I will add graphics and a 
more fluid gaming experience.

My purpose for making this is to learn C++ to a much greater extent.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio was used to develop this.

I used the map and list libraries in order to make my game loop function.
